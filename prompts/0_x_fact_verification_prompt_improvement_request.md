# Request: Improve My “Deep Research” Prompt (Twitter/X Fact Verification via Prediction Markets)

## What I’m building

I want to implement a better system for fighting misinformation / fact-checking using **prediction markets** and the **latest technology and software advancements**.

I’m writing a prompt that will make AI (ChatGPT) do **very deep research** and **deep thinking** using:

- the PDFs/documents I’m going to provide, and
- the internet.

## Your task

Write a **single, high-quality prompt** that I can give to the AI for this project.

- You **may add** additional relevant things the AI should try/explore.
- **Do not lock into a single approach too early**: keep the solution path open-ended (don’t “fix the path” right now).
- The prompt should instruct the AI to **read the provided documents** to understand the problem, requirements, and possible pathways for prediction markets and modern approaches across betting markets, AI, crypto, game theory, and software/technology.

## Problem statement (what the deep-research prompt should ask the AI to design)

For Twitter/X posts, design a system so that users can know whether a post is:

- **true**
- **false**
- **misleading**
- **misinformation**

…or provide a **probability estimate** for factuality.

The system must have **aligned incentives**.

## Motivation / baseline to improve

Twitter/X Community Notes exists today, but it’s not very effective:

- the quality often becomes like a comment thread, and
- incentives of participants aren’t aligned.

## Core mechanism + incentive requirements to preserve

The improved prompt must ensure the AI addresses all of the following:

- Verifiers (people “betting” / forecasting the factuality of a tweet) should have **strong incentive alignment**.
- If most users predict one outcome, but a minority predicts another outcome and the minority is eventually correct, the minority should receive a **suitably higher reward**.
- If a verifier/prediction-market participant is wrong, there should be an associated **penalty**.
- The system should improve/replace Community Notes using **prediction markets** (e.g., **vetting markets** or similar truth-resolution mechanisms).
- The design should be systematic and structurally grounded in:
  - game theory
  - information theory
  - stock-market / market microstructure ideas
  - prediction market design
- Predictors with consistently high accuracy at predicting truth should have **strong incentives/rewards** when their predictions are correct.
- The AI should adopt the stance of a **pro-Twitter/X user** who knows Twitter/X and its systems well, and must propose something that is **practical** and **works in the real world**.

## Technologies to explore (must be included)

For this use case, the prompt should instruct the AI to explore recent advancements in:

- AI / artificial intelligence
- LLMs / Gen-AI
- blockchain
- DAOs
- crypto / web3

## Output requirements for the resulting deep-research work

The improved prompt you produce should instruct the AI (when run later) to output a:

1. **Theoretical design** with some **crucial implementation specifics**, such that another AI could implement an **MVP prototype**.
2. **Structured proposal**, including **system architecture**.
3. Design that stays within current **US regulatory boundaries**, while still considering state-of-the-art technology in:
   - software systems
   - AI
   - betting markets / prediction markets
   - blockchain/crypto (e.g., DAOs, contracts)
4. Focus on what’s mostly possible **today**, with a small forward-looking window (**~1–3 years**) allowed.

## Critical instruction

Return **only the improved prompt**.

- Do **not** do the deep research and deep thinking of the system yet.
