Prediction markets and Community Notes are becoming the two flagship social epistemic technologies of the 2020s.

Both truth-seeking and democratic, built around open public participation rather than pre-selected elites.

I want to see many more things like this.

Regardless of who wins from here, I definitely think that the prediction markets have proven themselves more accurate than the polls/models this time around.

Seeing that Zuckerberg wants to introduce Community Notes and YouTube is allegedly trialling something similar, I predict it will be a spectacular failure and in a few years you'll understand why I said this. 

Collective intelligence is a nice idea but it's fraught with difficulties in practice. The question how to get groups to be more intelligent than its member has been studied a lot by sociologists and I don't see that X is doing anything to avoid the obvious pitfalls. 

This starts with information cascades and anchoring bias and goes all the way to the problem that ultimately the people who will win are those who can afford to invest more time into it.

It's funny how people on this platform complain about the bias on Wikipedia but at the same time believe that they are immune to the same problem. 

Really I'm just writing this so that 2 years down the line I can say I told you so.

As I said in my post earlier this year... there's been a crypto/AI intersection use case in plain sight for a decade, it's bots market-making DEXes.

A lot of fruitful avenues in extending this to prediction markets, and then to adjudication games in DAOs.
